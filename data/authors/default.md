Hey, Iâ€™m Nikola, I'm a full stack developer with a passion for coding, innovation and learning new technologies. I love building from IoT projects to beautiful applications and anything in between.

I like to spend my time building projects that interest me, as well as pushing myself to learn more through open source projects and share my knowledge with other developers.

Some of the technologies I like using:

- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Three.js
